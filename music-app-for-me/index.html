	<h1 class="post-title">A music app in Java, that still works eight years later!</h1>
	<p>My high school IT class (so, 2010) culminated in a programming project – we were free to create whatever we wanted (in Java), so long as we demonstrated what we'd learned in the class. I'd started teaching myself Java two years earlier, with a very simple command-line based music organizer: you typed in metadata, had it displayed back to you in a simple table, and probably didn't expect it to still be there next time you ran the program.</p><p>In the intervening year, a friend and I had spent many late dorm-room nights fiddling with the program. Coding without internet (no StackOverflow, no new packages) seems unimaginable looking back.</p><p>So it seemed like the obvious choice to pick this up again for my high school project, but with a GUI (all the rage) and actual music-playing abilities. I hijacked an mp3 reading library (<a href="https://www.javazoom.net/jlgui/api.html">JavaZOOM</a>), (mis-)used a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(Java)">javax.swing</a> and created an assortment of lovely Objects, and ended up with something almost as useful as iTunes v1.0. Thus was born the <a href="https://github.com/carderne/CAMO">Chris Arderne Music O</a>rganiser!</p><p>Miraculously – writing this in late 2018 – the program still (mostly) works!</p> <video width="100%" height="500" controls>
