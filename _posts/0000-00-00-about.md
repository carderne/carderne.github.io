Hi, I'm Chris.

I spend my work time exploring data and the geospatial world and thinking of interesting ways to share what I find. Since 2017 I've been working at the World Bank Group, on the intersection of data analysis and energy access. It's a fun mix of of hard data stuff, and harder stakeholder stuff.

I've been pushing the use of open data and supporting the private sector ecosystem. I've worked extensively with [HOT](https://www.hotosm.org/) on very exciting OpenStreetMap work, including a project to [map several million buildings in Tanzania](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/mini-grids/). In the last year I've worked on broader topics related to finance and technology, and have been lucky enough to work with [iRise Hub](http://irisehub.so/) in Mogadishu.

I'm available for freelance work wherever the topics above intersect. Data analysis, energy planning, geospatial work. Even general Python development if it's something interesting.

Mostly, I like to be outside, either in the mountains or in the sea. I've documented some of my larger trips on the blog and hope to add more.
