Our bags are just about packed, and after two amazing years of living in Barcelona, we're getting ready for the move to Oxford. Because what better time than a global pandemic to make new friends and integrate in a new community!

Spain let me in on a special "non-lucrative" visa that lets me live but not work here. The UK has seen fit to grant me the [Global Talent visa](https://technation.io/news/the-new-global-talent-visa/) (n√©e 'Exceptional Talent') and as soon as we hear back from the immigration lot (fingers crossed), Sarah will be on board as well (update: she is).
