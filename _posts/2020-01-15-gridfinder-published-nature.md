Over the last year, I did some very fun work using satellite imagery (night-time lights) and OpenStreetMap data to predict the location of global electrical grid infrastructure. I wrote about it briefly on this blog [here](/night-time-lights-find-grid/) and as a World Bank blog [here](https://blogs.worldbank.org/energy/using-night-lights-map-electrical-grid-infrastructure). And now finally its seeing the light of day as a published article in Nature Scientific Data:

**[Predictive mapping of the global power system using open data](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-019-0347-4)**

You can also visualize the full global dataset at [gridfinder.org](https://gridfinder.org/) and download the [full dataset](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3369106). Please have a look, use it if its useful, and keep in mind the (big!) caveats before treating it as ground-truth.
