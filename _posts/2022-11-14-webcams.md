Raisons d'etre for this post:
- I want to lower the (already quite low) standards on here, make it easier to post more crap more often.
- A small, even lower-effort sequel to my [previous post](/blog/video-calls).
- My brother asked me what webcam he should buy, I responded with some ideas, he said I should post it on the blog, here we are.

If you read the previous post, you know I have a Logitech C920 (no link for you).
It's okay, does the job, better than whatever built-in thing you have.
Plus you can get a little slidey privacy thing from eBay for a few <currency>.

But these are better{%- include fn.html n=1 -%}:
- Your phone, with Camo or something similar. I tried this (albeit a Linux-friendly version) but found it too much faff.
- Your mirrorless camera or similar, if you have one. I don't. Also faff.
- [Elgato Facecam](https://www.elgato.com/en/facecam) (~£140): seems pretty solid, doesn't have a microphone, which I love (one less thing to not accidentally choose).
- [Opal C1](https://opalcamera.com/) (~£250??): doesn't seem possible to actually buy this (yet?) unless you know someone/something.
- [Lumina](https://getlumina.com/) (~£150??): [other bloggers](https://macwright.com/2022/07/07/lumina-review.html) say it's decent, doesn't seem easy to find in the UK.
- [Razer Kiyo Pro](https://www.razer.com/gb-en/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo-pro/RZ19-03640100-R3M1) (~£100): seems decent, probably not as solid as the ones above but definitely better than the C920.
- Dell UltraSharp (~£150): also no webcam (a positive), reviews seem to say quality is great.
- Logitech Brio (~£240): Super expensive, haven't read overly positive things about it compared to the options above.
