I added two new sections to this site, one for [photos](/photos) and the other for [books](/books). Thanks to the minimalist trend that I've somehow jumped on, they both work without any JavaScript! Luckily I've been pretty fastidious about recording books since about 2011 so it was easy to repurpose my growing Excel file for the blog. For the photos, I'm slowly backfilling â€” I'm up to 2017!

Have a look!
