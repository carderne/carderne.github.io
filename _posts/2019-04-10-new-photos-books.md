I added two new sections to this site, one for [photos](/photos) and the other for [books](/books). Thanks to the minimalist trend that I've somehow jumped on, they both work without any JavaScript. Luckily I've been pretty fastidious about recording books since 2011 so it was easy to repurpose my growing Excel file for the blog.

In a moment of boredom last week, I also created this: [How Much Couscous](https://rdrn.me/couscous/). It's a very opinionated hiking/climbing food planner, aimed at those of us (me, as far as I know) that prefer to eat nothing but couscous and oats while out in the wilderness.

Have a look!
