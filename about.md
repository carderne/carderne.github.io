Hi, I'm Chris.

I spend my work time exploring data and the geospatial world and thinking of interesting ways to share what I find. Since 2017 I've been working at the World Bank Group, on the intersection of data analysis and energy access. It's a fun mix of of hard data stuff, and harder stakeholder stuff.

In pushing the use of open data in development, I've worked extensively with [HOT](https://www.hotosm.org/) on cool OpenStreetMap work, including a project to [map millions of buildings in Tanzania](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/mini-grids/). Recently I've worked on broader topics related to finance and technology, and have been lucky enough to work with [iRise Hub](http://irisehub.so/) in Mogadishu.

I'm available for freelance work wherever the topics above meet. Data analysis, energy planning, geospatial work. Even general Python development if it's something interesting.
