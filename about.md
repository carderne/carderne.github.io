I'm the guy in the picture: Chris Arderne. I set up this blog so that I can't be accused of non-internet-existence after getting rid of most other social media stuff. Also to actually replicate some of the sharing functions I'm missing out. Also to seem legitimate and active to future employers.

My work time is spent exploring data and the geospatial world and thinking of interesting ways to share what I find. Since 2017 I've been working at the World Bank Group, on the intersection of data science and energy access. It's a fun mix of of hard data stuff, and harder stakeholder stuff.

In pushing the use of open data in development, I've worked extensively with [HOT](https://www.hotosm.org/) on cool OpenStreetMap work, including a project to [map millions of buildings in Tanzania](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/mini-grids/). Recently I've worked on broader topics related to finance and technology, and have been lucky enough to work with [iRise Hub](http://irisehub.so/) in Mogadishu. I also did a fun bit of work called [gridfinder](https://github.com/carderne/gridfinder) based on some stuff developed by Brandon Rohrer, now of iRobot.

I'm currently quite busy with various projects, but am potentially available for freelance work wherever the topics above meet. Data analysis, energy planning, geospatial work. Even general Python development if it's something interesting!
