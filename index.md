<h1 class="big-header fancy-shadow">CHRIS ARDERNE</h1>


I'm a software/infra/data engineer and love building and breaking and tinkering.
If I'm inside but not at the computer, I'm probably <a href="/books/">reading</a>.
And when outside, I'd ideally be climbing <a href="/photos/">mountains</a> but more frequently running and cycling.

Currently I'm building <a href="https://www.translucent.io/">Translucent</a>, the next-gen multi-entity accountancy SaaS.

I've been lucky enough to work across the tech spectrum: designing systems, building apps and services, exploring data, taming models.

By day I write Python (with Pyright set to hard mode) and TypeScript (tRPC + Next.js aren't so bad), while by night I enjoy Go and Rust and playing with LLMs (because who doesn't).

I've worked with some <span class="fire">hot</span> startups in the finance, climate and energy spaces, supported top research institutions and multinationals.

Please click through to the <a href="/blog/">blog</a>, where I alternate between nerdery and mountain-ery.
