I'm a geo/software/data person with a strong interest in sustainable development, creating lasting impact, and climbing mountains.
Available for consultancy or advisory (or just advice) wherever these interests overlap.

Since leaving the World Bank, I've enjoyed working with some <span class="fire">hot</span> startups in the climate, financial and energy spaces, supported top research institutions, and tried to focus on meaningful, impactful work.

Some fun things, old and new, that I've enjoyed:
working with [HOT](https://www.hotosm.org/) to map millions of buildings in East Africa;
publishing our work on [gridfinder](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0347-4);
organising a session on earth observation at Data Science Africa in Accra;
[winning](https://www.h2ox.org/) the World Resources Institute's prediction hackathon;
learning (a little) about [electricity market](https://www.habitat.energy/) algos.


Please click through to the <a href="/blog/">blog</a>, where I alternate between nerdery and mountain-ery. Hopefully there's something interesting for the discerning reader.
