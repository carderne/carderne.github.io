I'm a software/data/geo person with a strong interest in sustainability, durable impact, and climbing mountains.

I've enjoyed working with some <span class="fire">hot</span> startups in the climate, financial and energy spaces, supported top research institutions, and tried to focus on meaningful, impactful work.

Please click through to the <a href="/blog/">blog</a>, where I alternate between nerdery and mountain-ery. Hopefully there's something interesting for the discerning reader.
