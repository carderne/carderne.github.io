I'm a geospatial data scientist with a strong interest in sustainable development, creating lasting value, and climbing mountains. I'm generally available for consultancy or advisory work wherever these interests overlap.

I've worked extensively with the World Bank and other donors, top research institutions, and <span id="fire">hot</span> new startups in remote sensing. Recent highlights that I've enjoyed: worked with the [Humanitarian Openstreetmap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/) to map millions of buildings in East Africa; developed and published [gridfinder](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0347-4); advising the EU on the use of AI in allocating development finance; working with a cross-disciplinary team on tracking pollution from industry.

I blog from time to time, using this as a stand-in for my lack of other social media. Hopefully there's something interesting for the discerning reader.
