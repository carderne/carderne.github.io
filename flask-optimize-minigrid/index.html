	<h1 class="post-title">A Flask app for mini-grid planning with a cost-optimised spanning tree</h1>
	<p>As part of ongoing work on energy access in Tanzania, we (the IFC, together with REA) have mapped over 4 million buildings in rural parts of the country. This gives loads of new possibilities to those looking to work in these areas, and not only in the energy sector. One of these is the ability to conduct detailed site assessments, including sensible estimates of household populations and potential demand, along with wiring requirements to connect a village.</p><p>Apart from  the potential for use in state planning for new grid extensions, this data is valuable to private developers looking to sell off-grid services such as stand-alone solar systems (such as those sold by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-mkopa-solar-in-africa/">M-Kopa</a>) as well as more capital intensive mini-grid systems (with a power source and grid connecting households, but no connection to the national grid), which <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/minigrids-are-the-cheapest-way-to-electrify-100-million-africans-today">some suggest</a> are a key to tackling energy access issues.</p><p>In this post I'm focusing on mini-grids, mostly because it's a more interesting problem to analyse. However, I also provide some cost comparisons with national grid connections. This post is split into two main sections:</p><ol><li>Using a minimum spanning tree and cost-optimisation algorithm to find the ideal network layout for a given village and parameters</li><li>Serving this as a GIS web app with Flask, where users can customise inputs, run the model, and visualise results</li></ol><p>So if you just want an example of a basic Flask app, go ahead and skip to the second section. Or just check out the <a href="https://github.com/carderne/minigrid-optimiser">GitHub repo</a> for the code for both sections.</p><h2 id="1-optimising-mini-grids-in-rural-villages">1. Optimising mini-grids in rural villages</h2><p>As I've covered <a href="/open-data-access-tanzania/">elsewhere</a>, data is one of the key barriers to ramping up off-grid development and investment. Machine learning and ML-supported manual mapping in OpenStreetMap (a strategy we applied in Tanzania) are starting to make inroads into this problem, at least for assessing demand.</p><p>As a test case, I've chosen the village of <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=Tanzania#map=15/-5.0719/32.2804">Sipungu</a> in the Tabora region of Tanzania. To start off with, let's see how this village looks in OpenStreetMap compared to Google Maps. Each of the 444 little shapes on the left is a building, accurately traced by the HOT team in Dar es Salaam as part of the IFC project. Some are homes, some are stores, some are schools. As you can see, there's no information in Google Maps about this village – not even the road in.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2018/11/sipungu_compare_maps2.png" class="kg-image"></figure><p>To find the optimum way of connecting all these buildings to a mini-grid system, we turn to network theory, and in particular, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree">minimum spanning tree</a>. This is the set of lines that connects a group of points with the minimum total distance (or other cost function). For the village of Sipungu, this looks as follows, where each blue dot is a building (very small ones filtered) and the green point a randomly chosen location for the solar PV installation.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="../content/images/2018/11/mst.png" class="kg-image"></figure><p>Our goal then is to determine, based on some criteria, which of these connections to maintain. The first step is to <em>direct </em>the network from the PV installation outwards, so that the model knows where to start in looking for connections to drop or keep. We don't want to accidentally disconnect the PV system itself! This is a process not dissimilar to the stream ordering used in my <a href="/modelling-hydrological-networks/">hydrological modelling</a>. Conceptually they fall in with a broad range of physical, mathematical and <a href="/visualizing-book-club-ai/">social</a> problems<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory"> </a>where network theory is applied.</p><p>There are a number of different ways to cost-optimise this network; I chose a brute force approach to find the configuration with the highest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value">net present value</a>, i.e. the most money for the developer, taking into account the future income streams and costs. This sounds like a ruthless way of thinking, but for more mini-grids to get built and more people to get access to electricity, they need to be sustainable. The hope is that once the system is running, demand will increase and more households will become profitable to connect.</p><p>The algorithm starts with the complete network, and considers which single <em>deletion </em>of a line a connecting two households provide the biggest boost to profitability. For example, a very small household far away from any others - lots of wire, but not much demand or electricity sold. It then repeats this process over and over again until there are no more profitable configurations to be found and that is the optimum network!</p><p>I contrived the following main parameters for the village of Sipungu, along with some heuristics for determining the number of people based on building size.</p><ul><li>Minimum building size: 30 m<sup>2</sup></li><li>Wire cost: 25 USD/m</li><li>Connection cost: 150 USD/household</li><li>Tariff: 0.25 USD/kWh</li><li>Demand: 6 kWh/person/month</li><li>Generator cost: 7,000 USD/kW</li></ul><p>With these inputs, the </p><iframe src="https://127.0.0.1:2368/flask-optimize-minigrid/embed-map-sipungu.html" style="width: 100%; height: 400px" name="internal" frameborder="0"></iframe><ul><li>results</li><li>summary results that I created!</li></ul><h2 id="2-creating-a-simple-gis-web-app-with-flask">2. Creating a simple GIS web app with Flask</h2><p>So that's a pretty straight-forward prototype for mini-grid planning, so long as they're comfortable with a bit of Python. What if we want to extend this to others – a web app!</p><ul><li>basic Flask set up</li><li>handling multiple users</li><li>pushing to server</li><li>running in background</li></ul>
